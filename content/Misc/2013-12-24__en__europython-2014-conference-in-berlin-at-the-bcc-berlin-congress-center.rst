The next EuroPython conference will be held from July 21 - 27, 2014 at the bcc
Berlin Congress Center in the heart of Berlin. The EuroPython conference is the
second largest global conference for the popular programming language Python,
after the PyCon US conference in North America. The bcc is located at the
central Alexander Square. It offers ideal facilities for a developer conference
on 3,000 m2. The organizers are expecting up to 1,200 participants, continuing
the growth of the EuroPython conference series. The very successful EuroPython
this year attracted almost 900 Python enthusiasts. It was hosted in Florence,
Italy for the third time running.

Berlin offers ideal conditions for a large international developer conference.
The city with its about 2,500 young businesses has a large and fast-growing
start-up scene. 300 universities, polytechnics, research institutes and
technology parks underline Berlin's importance as one of Europe's leading
science and research locations. Thanks to its rich cultural landscape with
around 180 museums, renowned international art collections and precious works
of art as well as a lively art and music scene, Berlin is one of the most
vibrant and vividly creative metropolitan centers in Europe. Its attractions
and excellent national and international transport links have already put
Berlin among the top three in the international conference and congress region
rankings.

The conference will be organized locally by the Python Software Verband e.V.,
the Python Users Berlin, the Django User Group Berlin and the PyLadies Berlin,
in cooperation with the EuroPython Society for the Python community. With five
lecture tracks and two tutorial tracks running in parallel, the EuroPython
conference offers an attractive schedule for all attendees.

The EuroPython 2014 logo expresses what is on the organizer's minds, which is
getting people from very different areas of expertise together to communicate.
Python is used as a programming language in industrial and service enterprises
as well as in research and education. The EuroPython brings together developers
who work together on fascinating tasks and as a result have found unique
solutions to their problems.
