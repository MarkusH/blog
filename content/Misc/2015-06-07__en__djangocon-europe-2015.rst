:summary: 2015's DjangoCon Europe with 350 attendees edition took place in the
   beautiful city of Cardiff, Wales, UK.


The Announcement
================

The announcement for `DjangoCon Europe 2015`_ -- as the conference itself --
was vast. A six day conference, including an open day, open and free to the
public, three days of "conference talks", two days of code sprints, workshops
and code clinics. Furthermore, yet another `DjangoGirls`_ event. The organizers
also took up the cause of making the most diverse, accessible and social
responsible DjangoCon ever. And, from my perspective, they succeeded! The team
around `Daniele Procida`_ organized a memorable conference that around 350
people attended. Thank You!


My Trip to Cardiff
==================

My trip to Cardiff wasn't my first time in the UK, but it was the longest. All
the times I have be to UK before, were shorter. And all these other trips were
way rainier that this time.

My plane left Berlin Tegel Airport (TXL) on May 30th at 6am, quite early in the
morning. On the plus side, I already met Erik Romijn, another Django committer,
at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (AMS) for our flight to Cardiff Airport (CWL).
Interestingly, our airline, KLM, overbooked the flight and was offering 250 EUR
to the first person that would take a later flight.

On both, the flight from TXL to AMS and after the conference from CWL to AMS,
KLM served sandwiches. And these sandwiches perfectly aligned with one of the
policies of the conference: social responsibility.

Cardiff's Architecture
======================

The conference and all related events took place at `Cardiff University`_ (a
huge thank you for being involved!) and Cardiff City Hall.

DjangoGirls
-----------

Especially Cardiff University conveys a sense of good old British university
life. The stunning building, with its many small corridors and corners, served
well for the DjangoGirls workshop, putting everybody back into (or forward to)
their university life.

Conference Dinner
-----------------

Right next to Cardiff City Hall, the National Museum Cardiff was host for the
conference dinner. I can't really remember what the meal was called, but I
know, it was really good and tasty.

Cardiff Castle
--------------

Cardiff's landmark is its castle (Welsh: Castell Caerdydd). It "was built in
the late 11th century by Norman invaders on top of a 3rd-century Roman fort."
[Wiki]_

The Conference
==============

Talks
-----

The conference itself was great. The organizers encouraged people that hadn't
been on stage to give a presentation in front of hundreds of people. And it
worked quite good. I've seen many first time speakers and I was one myself,
talking about "`Forms are static -- No, they aren't`_" and my first Django
third-party app `django-dynamic-forms`_

The `opening keynote`_ by `Baptiste Mispelon`_ was a story of "how he tackled
burnout by traveling around Europe, eating Welsh cakes, pierogi and
stroopwafel" [DCE15]_. The entire story made out of Emoji, his favorite
language. Nothing even close to programming or code, but an insightful and
honest statement of a common problem in IT.

.. speakerdeck:: 9fdb5f5c51e14362aa3e993af3ee0b96

This topic, to listen to yourself and to your friends and colleagues around
you, was also supported by the wellbeing service of Cardiff University that
offered free sessions for everybody who wanted to talk to somebody and get some
recommendations or ideas.but

But even more surprising -- at least to me and likely many others in the
audience -- was `Russell Keith-Magee's`_ lightning about his illness. Thank you
for being so open, trusting us with your story and get well soon :)

Another talk I specifically want to mention here, is the keynote from the
second day by `Ola Sendecka`_: `Into the rabbit hole`_, about a girl Alice in
Djangoland. But the most impressive about this talk was not the content (that
was great and correct), but the hand painted images.

.. speakerdeck:: 6b472deb9c5441b1be2491e2fd2de2bb
   :ratio: 1.41241379310345

There were plenty of other talks I enjoyed a lot, because they explained
something difficult in a simple way (`Ana Balica`_: `Demystifying mixins with
Django`_), because they showed something outside Django's normal use case
(Dafydd Evans: CAMEL, the Cardiff Maths e-learning project), or because they
showed once more that computer science, and computer security in particular, is
hard (`James Bennett`_: The net is dark and full of terrors).


Accessibility
-------------

As already announced, the organizers wanted everybody to feel welcome. And an
important support for people with hearing disabilities were the live
transcripts by `Sheryll Holley`_ and Hilary Maclean, that are now `public`_ for
everybody to read.

One Direction
=============

The most important part of the entire DjangoCon, though, were the two One
Direction concerts on Friday and Saturday evening after the conference. About
110 000 fans and visitors were expected. That is a third of the population of
Cardiff:
