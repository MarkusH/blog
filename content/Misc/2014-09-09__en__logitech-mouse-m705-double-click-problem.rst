Logitech mouse M705 double click problem
========================================

A few years back, it must be around 2011, I bought a `Logitech M705 mouse`_. A
few days ago this mouse behaved wired. Almost every single left click turned
into a double click. Looking through the Internet it seemed to be a common
problem.

I replaced the mouse with an even older one laying around, thinking I'd
probably need to replace it with a new one sooner than later. Today though I
searched for a way to fix the double click problem. I ended up finding a
`YouTube video`_ showing how to dismantle the mouse, fix a part and put the
components back together.

Problem solved. The mouse is as good as new. At least for now.
