Two days ago the `KDE`_ team `released`_ the first release candidate of the
*Plasma Workspaces* towards version 4.10. The biggest changes that directly
catches ones eyes are the graphical modifications and improvements. For me they
look much more seamless. I also like the new wallpaper. Looking under to hood,
there are many changes. I just want to point out my most favorite ones:

* A new `QtQuick`_ based screen locker.
* Scriptable effects â€“ One can easily write desktop effects without knowledge of
  C/C++
* The notification applet is now based on `QML`_ and feels much smoother
* The Nepomuk Indexer has been rewritten and is much faster as far as I can see.


Of course there are many, many more changes.
