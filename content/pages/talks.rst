Writing Safe Database Migrations in Django
------------------------------------------

My talk from `DjangoCon Europe 2021
<https://cfp.2021.djangocon.eu/2021/talk/F9J8CU/>`__.

Whether you build Django projects or apps, you won't get past database
migrations. And Django's built-in migration framework is great. It works
tremendously. But that's only on the surface. Whenever you deploy your code and
apply migrations in production, you are about to enter dangerous territory. I
will point out common pitfalls and show you ways to avoid them. And with some
additional best practices at hand, you will be ready for your next production
deployment.

A Pony On The Move: How Migrations Work In Django üêé
----------------------------------------------------

My talk from `DjangoCon Europe 2020
<https://cfp.2021.djangocon.eu/porto/talk/CEGCQX/>`__.

Django‚Äôs migration framework has been around for almost 6 years. From the
outset, it had a long journey ahead, considering all the learnings and
experience Andrew Godwin had with the 3rd party package South. However,
Django‚Äôs migrations are not to be considered a rewrite of South as they work
fundamentally different.

This talk will give an insight view into the components that make up Django‚Äôs
migration framework. The talk will lay-out how these components fit and work
together. It will outline major challenges and problems that were encountered
and overcome along the way.

One of the goals of this talk is to reduce the entry barrier for potential
Django contributors to the rather complex migration framework. From their own
experience, the author is well aware that there are some parts that are tricky
and non-trivial and non-obvious. Thus, this talk is absolutely aimed at
prospective contributors, regardless if they are first-time Django contributors
or ones with a year-long track record.

All Hands on Deck ‚Äî Handling Security Issues
--------------------------------------------

My talk from `The Lead Developer Berlin 2019
<https://berlin2019.theleaddeveloper.com/talks#markus-holtermann>`__ conference.

In this talk, we will look into what it means for a company when there is a
security issue in a piece of software. This talk will provide suggestions on
who needs to get involved.

We live in a world of technology and engineering. Almost everything around us
requires software. Unfortunately, the software we use or build has bugs. While
most bugs can be fixed, there are these other types of bugs, called
vulnerabilities, that cause headaches and haunt us at night. Security issues
can be found in our own infrastructure, on customers' infrastructure, or ‚Äî
worse ‚Äî around user data. It is on us as engineers to do the best we can to not
make security issues in the first place. But it is on everybody involved in a
product to provide communication, guidance, and support when an issue exists.

Logging Rethought 2: The Actions of Frank Taylor Jr. -- DjangoCon EU, PyCon AU, PyCon UK
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My talk from `DjangoCon Europe 2019
<https://2019.djangocon.eu/talks/logging-rethought-2-the-actions-of-frank-taylor-jr/>`__,
`PyCon AU 2019
<https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/logging-rethought-2-the-actions-of-frank-taylor-jr>`__
and `PyCon UK <https://pretalx.com/pyconuk-2019/talk/WJGTWP/>`__.

We build services, potentially used by thousands or even millions of people.
And despite all the testing we do, some interactions with these services will
not work out the way we hope. Wouldn't it be great to reconstruct what let to a
problem and analyze if the problem occurred at other times?

Less Obvious Things To Do With Django's ORM -- PyCon SK
-------------------------------------------------------

My `PyCon SK 2019 <https://2019.pycon.sk/en/>`__ talk.

Django's ORM is powerful. And it has been for ages. It only became even more
powerful over the last years. Django's ORM can be intimidating because it can
do so many things. And it can also be confusing when trying to find out how to
do things.

On The Look-Out For Your Data -- DjangoCon EU
---------------------------------------------

My `DjangoCon Europe 2018 <https://2018.djangocon.eu/>`__ talk.

Do you have data in the database of your Django project? Do you want to find
that needle in the haystack of your data? There are plenty options how you can
achieve that. With various levels of complexity, confidence, and reliability.
I'll give an insight into what the most common are nowadays.

Thoughts About Normal and Abnormal Data -- PyCon UK
---------------------------------------------------

A lot of data lives in relational databases. And there are relations between
records in these databases. Relations that might be normal or abnormal.

To Index Or Not, That's Not The Questions -- DjangoCon EU
---------------------------------------------------------

As databases are used to store more and more information every day, these are
also a key component in every Django project. Thus it's important to understand
how they work.

Django and 2 Factor Authentication -- DjangoCon AU
--------------------------------------------------

Most websites these days require some kind of authentication. User name &
password is the most common one. OAuth with Facebook / Github / Google /
Twitter is also common. But sometimes you can't rely on 3rd party services and
user name & password is not enough. In those cases 2 Factor Authentication is a
nice, additional security layer. Use e.g. a phone to ensure a more secure
authentication.

SSL All The Things -- PyCon AU / PyCon NZ
-----------------------------------------

A revised version of my talk from DjangoCon US targeted at a more generic
Python audience. Instead of having Django specific code and slides I show how
to use Python's built-in ``ssl`` module.

SSL All The Things -- DjangoCon US
----------------------------------

Over the last few years SSL/TLS encryption of not only websites but many other
services as well has risen tremendously. The Let's Encrypt organization and
certificate authority (CA) makes that pretty easy. Since September 2015 almost
1.8 million certificates have been issued. And you can use it, too. For free!

In this talk I'll demonstrate how to integrate SSL/TLS and point out some
common pitfalls. I'll briefly layout the Let's Encrypt ACME protocol and
explain what you need to set up in Django to make SSL/TLS the default and only
way to access your site.

Don't be afraid of writing migrations -- DjangoCon EU
-----------------------------------------------------

With Django 1.7 the built-in migrations framework was introduced. With the
release of version 1.9, the migrations framework is much more robust, faster
and can handle many more edge cases.

While the ``makemigrations`` management command became smarter in the last two
releases in terms of detecting what has changed and what migrations to
generate, there are still a couple of things Django cannot do automatically.

I will point out some of the common cases where you should get your hands
dirty, and show you how writing migrations is easier than you think. Migrations
are just Python code, and are as much a part of your apps as your models,
forms, and views. After all, they were always meant to be human-writable.

The Necessity of Configuration and System Management Tools -- PyCon AU
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I gave this talk during `PyCon Australia 2015 <http://2015.pycon-au.org/>`__ in
Brisbane.

In practically every moment of our life we rely on the possibly largest
communication medium humanity ever had. The Internet. Being able to at least
partially understand how this *thing* works, we know that it takes a lot of
work to keep it running smoothly.

To do that IT administrators use configuration and system management tools to
deploy changes to thousands of servers and keep them in sync. But how can one
roll back a change done in the past that turned out to introduce a bug?

This talk I will introduce you to configuration management and explain the
problems that arise over time and make changing something back complicated or
even impossible.

You Should(n't) Normalize Your Database
---------------------------------------

This talk you make you start thinking about when database normalization -- as
you might have learned during computer science lessens at school or university
-- is a good approach and when you should actually avoid it. I gave this talk
at various occasions, one being the `pykonik

the Krakow Python meetup, where I have been invited to by the amazing `Ola
