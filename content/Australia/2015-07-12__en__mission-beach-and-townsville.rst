:summary: While Mission Beach provides a nice beach for water sport activities,
   Townsville's "The Beach" is not that interesting.


`Mission Beach`_ is a small town along Australia's east coast with a beautiful
beach which can be used for swimming and surfing. `Townsville`_\'s
"`The Strand`_", on the other hand, is much more venomous with loads of
stingers. Swimming without a stinger suite is not recommended.
