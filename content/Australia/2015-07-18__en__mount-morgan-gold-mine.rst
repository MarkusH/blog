:summary: The Mount Morgan Gold Mine was Australia's largest above ground gold
   mine until it was closed in 1981.


`Mount Morgan`_ is a town with a population of 2,000 people nowadays. Back in
1882 the `gold mine`_ around the corner was opened. During its operation time
it produced more than 260 tons of gold. While in the beginning the mining was
below ground, it shifted to open-cut around 1950. During its modernization it
was also officially changed into a copper mine. Which makes sense, given that
it yield almost 400k tons of copper.

What you can see on the 4th image is the man-made open-cut, filled with acid
water (pH level of 3.4). The Queensland government is currently cleaning up
"the mess" the miners left in 1981: acid and deadly water for fish and plants.
