:summary: The Mount Coot-tha lookout provides a gorgeous view over the
   "Brisbane Valley" and its astonishing extend


Today I walked from the suburb Toowong to the `Mount Coot-tha Summit Lookout`_.
From there one has a phenomenal view over the "Brisbane Valley". What sticks
out is the Brisbane CBD with its skyscrapers in the north-east, and the
mountains in the south-west, remains of an old volcano.
