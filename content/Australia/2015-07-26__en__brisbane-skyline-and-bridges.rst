:summary: Out of the 15 bridges over the Brisbane River 8 are in Brisbane.


Yesterday and today the weather in Brissy was really nice. I walked around a
lot, just enjoying the weather. I still love the view from South Bank and
Kangaroo Point. Although many Australians were outside as well I didn't find it
too busy, which is a huge difference to Manhattan.

What I also like about Brisbane are the many bridges. Brisbane has 8 of them,
out of 15 bridges over the Brisbane River in total. From west to east: `Go
Between`_, `Merivale`_, `William Jolly`_, `Kurilpa`_, `Victoria`_, `Goodwill`_,
`Captain Cook`_, `Story`_. The most interesting from my point of view is by far
the `Kurilpa`_ bridge.
