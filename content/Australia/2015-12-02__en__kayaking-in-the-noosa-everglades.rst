:summary: The Noosa Everglades are known as the area along the Noosa River as
   part of the river and see system surrounding the beautiful city of Noosa
   Heads.


As another activity I went for a one day kayak hire a few days ago in the Noosa
Everglades. The everglades are the area surrounding the `Noosa River`_,
northwest of the beautiful city of `Noosa Heads`_.
