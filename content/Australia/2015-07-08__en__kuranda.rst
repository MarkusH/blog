:summary: The tropical rainforest near the Wet Tropics World Heritage listed
   Barron Gorge National Park provides a nice area to explore.


The historic town `Kuranda`_ is just a few kilometers from Cairns, in the middle
of a rainforest. There are multiple ways to get to the town: by car, public
transport or by the "`Scenic Railway`_". I chose the railway and enjoyed the ride
a lot.

The train was build from 1882 to 1891 to transport goods for the gold diggers,
after heavy rain flushed away all paths a few years prior.
