:summary: Yes, one can see kangaroos during sunrise! ðŸ˜ƒ


After getting up at 6am, I watched a beautiful sunrise and saw quite some wild
kangaroos on the beach at `Cape Hillsborough`_.

My next stop, after visiting the Sarina Sugar Shed was Cape Palmerson, with
red sand. Without light pollution one has a great look at all the stars. Due
to the lack of a better camera, I can only show you the `Crux`_.
