:summary: Melbourne is the capital of Victory and the second largest city
   Australia's with a population of close to 4.5 million people.


It's been a while since I wrote my last Australia post. I'm still here (in
Australia) and I'm going to continue travelling soon. For now, after PyCon AU
where I `presented my Master's thesis`_, I've been in Melbourne working with
the awesome team at `Common Code`_.

`Melbourne`_ is by far the most interesting city in Australia I've been to. Not
necessarily for it's ancient history (Sydney is older) but for its culture /
art background and good food and coffee. It certainly has its place in
Australia's history, though. On top of that, according to the Economist
Intelligence Unit's, Melbourne has once again be ranked the world's most
livable city.


History
=======

The state of Victory, which Melbourne is the capital of, was founded on July
1st 1851. Melbourne was a small town with a population of about 25,000 people.
However, with the discovery of gold, a few days later, more and more people
came to Melbourne and within months to population almost doubled. As I've been
told, on the day of discovery of gold, 40 of the 42 police officers quit their
job to dig for gold. 14 years later, Melbourne had overtaken Sydney as most
populous city Australia's. This time is commonly known as the `Victorian Gold
Rush`_ and the main reason for Melbourne's early success.

Culture & Art
=============

One of the most notable things about Melbourne is its street art. While most of
the artwork would likely be considered graffiti in Germany (even in Berlin, and
technically most of it is), those images are no graffiti tags or similar. They
are real pieces of art. I `published an album`_ with more photos than I can
show here.

Melbourne has lots of museums, most of them with free entrance. A surprisingly
interesting exhibition I visited was *The Australian Sketchbook* at the State
Library, with paintings going back to the early stages of the European
settlement in Australia.

Greater Melbourne Area
======================

Although I didn't really went beyond Melbourne's inner districts, I do have an
impression that it's worth seeing them from my flight from Brisbane to
Melbourne. I guess I have to come back for that:
