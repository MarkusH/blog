:summary: The Blue Mountains start about 50km west of Sydney and are named
   after their blue tinge when viewed from a distance. It is believed that
   this is due to the terpenoids emitted by the eucalyptus trees.


Today I drove up to the `Blue Mountains`_, a region starting about 50
kilometers west of New South Wales' capitol, Sydney. Their name is derived from
the blue-grey-ish tinge, which is believed to be caused by the loads of
volatile terpenoids, emitted from the thousands of eucalyptus trees. The Blue
Mountains are also home for over 400 types of animals, including the Koala.

While the weather was really great and the view was amazing, I sadly didn't see
any Koala.


Wentworth Falls
===============

The `Wentworth Falls`_ is a three-tiered waterfall fed by the Jamison Creek,
near the same-named city and have a total height of about 190 meters.

Katoomba Village
================

Katoomba is a small village in the Blue Mountains. It's main attraction is the
"`Three Sisters`_" rock formation.

While walking down to the Katoomba Falls -- not really much to see, they were
almost dried out -- I saw two parrots, though.
