:summary: The Cape Hillsborough National Park, about 130km south of Airlie
   Beach, is set on an old, inactive volcano and home to kangaroos, wallabies,
   and turtles.


My next stop is the `Cape Hillsborough National Park`_. Walking tracks through
the park guide to many lookouts from which one can have a look over the
gorgeous bay with its sand beach. In the early morning it is supposed to be
possible to see kangaroos down at the beach drinking from the sea.

This place is by far the most beautiful place I've seen here in Australia and a
must-go for everybody passing the exit "Seaforth" on "Bruce Highway".
