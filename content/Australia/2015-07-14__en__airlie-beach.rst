:summary: Airlie Beach is a small, touristic town near the Whitsunday Islands.


`Airlie Beach`_ is a small, touristic town with a population of only 2,700
people and part of the `Whitsunday Islands`_ region. It is a paradise for yacht
owners and backpackers. After a relaxing day at Boathabour Beach I went for a
run along the `Bicentennial Walkway`_.
