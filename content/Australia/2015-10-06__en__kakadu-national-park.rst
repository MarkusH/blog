:summary: The Kakadu National Park is one of Australia's largest national parks
   and covers an area of about 20,000 km². As a reference, Germany is 357,168
   km² in size.


The `Kakadu National Park`_'s name is not derived from the bird, but from the
mispronunciation of *Gaagudju*, which is the name of an Aboriginal language
formerly spoken in the northern part of the park [1]_.

The area of the park was formerly inhabited by many Aboriginal People. Over the
last centuries this changed, though, there are still a lot of Aboriginal
Australians living there. The main attraction of the park is likely the place
called "Ubirr". There are lots of rock paintings to see showing the history of
the Aboriginal culture.

The most gorgeous part of the park is the view from Ubirr rock, though. The
360° panoramic view over the floodplains and escarpments.

The bush fires you can see in the 3rd picture are common and vital to the
park's flora. After the white park organization stopped burning areas the fauna
collapsed and slowly started to recover once specifically lit fires have been
introduced again.

The climb of Ubirr rock is most valuable shortly before sunset. This allows the
awesome views shown above, but also allows you to enjoy to sunset

.. [1] Anthropologist Sir Baldwin Spencer's 'Native Tribes of the Northern
   Territory of Australia' (1914) was the source of the term 'Kakadu'. Spencer
   may have had in mind the German word 'kakadu', meaning cockatoo.
