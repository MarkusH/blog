:summary: The Whitsunday Islands are a collection of 74 islands off the coast
   of Queensland, next to Airlie Beach.


With some delay I finally found the time to write up another article.

2 weeks ago I went on a 3 day sailing trip around the `Whitsunday Islands`_.
One of the highlights of the tour was the visit of `Whitehaven Beach`_.

The sand on Whiteheaven Beach is very fine, making it a real danger for all
kinds of electronic devices such as cameras and mobile phones. Furthermore, the
sand consists of 98% pure silica which gives it its bright white color and
allows barefoot wakes even on a hot day.

Anther magical experience on the trip was the sunset and sunrise with nothing
really blocking the view, except for a sailing mast, maybe.
