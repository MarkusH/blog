:summary: Despite being disappointed from the Billabong Sanctuary I again
   visited another sanctuary which luckily was way nicer.


Yesterday I took a ride to the `Koala Sanctuary`_ near `Brisbane`_, despite
being disappointed from the `Billabong Sanctuary`_ . This one is actually way
nicer. The animals have way more space to live. The most impressive event was
the bird show which showed the fastest bird on earth, the `Peregrine falcon`_.
It can reach up to 400 km/h when flying! Unfortunately I wasn't able to get a
clear photo of it. But on the upside I saw a Tasmanian devil.
