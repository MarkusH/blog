:summary: My next stop is Cairns in the far north west of Queensland.


The "small" town `Cairns`_, with a population of about 150,000, is located on
the east cost of Australia. It is part of Queensland, Australia's
second-largest state. A bit north of Cairns, near Port Douglas, the largest
coral reef starts and extends south for 2,300 km: the `Great Barrier Reef`_.

While I didn't do much today, except flying from Sydney to Cairns, I took some
pictures from the plane and walked around Cairns' esplanade, enjoing my time
here.
