In about 14 hours my big journey starts. I'm heading for Australia on a working
holiday visa. I'll try to post a photo every day. But cell reception may not be
available all the time, especially when I'm in the outback.

My first 5 weeks are pretty much planned: I'll arrive in Sydney, stay in the
area for about 1 week and fly up to Cairns to drive south to Brisbane where
I'll eventually attend and `speak at PyCon Australia`_ presenting and
publishing my Master's thesis. After that I'll head to Melbourne.

As a start, here's my luggage:
