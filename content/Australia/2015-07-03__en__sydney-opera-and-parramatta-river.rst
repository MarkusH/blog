:summary: Sydney is Australia's largest city and the first stop of my journey.


After two flights (a stopover in Hong Kong) I arrived in Sydney last night.
And so far I haven't experienced any jet-lag.

         mountain crests.

Today I visited the `Opera House`_, Sydney's number one attraction. I also did
a Ferry Cruise up over the `Parramatta River`_. That gave me a beautiful look
on the skyline and the Harbour Bridge.
