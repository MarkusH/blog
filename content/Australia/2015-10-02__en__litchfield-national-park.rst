:summary: The 1500 kmÂ² Litchfield National Park is located about 100 km south
   of the city of Darwin in the Northern Territory.


The `Litchfield National Park`_ was proclaimed in 1986 and named after
Frederick Henry Litchfield, a main discoverer of the area. Its main attractions
are the waterfalls with seas underneath suitable for swimming. With the dry
season reaching its end and the wet season coming up these pools are a really
nice refreshment.

Lots of hills in the park provide nice tracks for short hikes and beautiful
views over the park.
