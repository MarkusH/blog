:summary: Brisbane, the capital of the not so sunny sunshine state Queensland.


Unfortunately, the last days in `Brisbane`_ weren't that nice, with regard to
the weather. The capital of the sunshine state Queensland presents itself with
a lot of drizzle and rain. Anyway, I nevertheless walked around the city and
visited the botanical garden, amongst other things, like the Brisbane Museum in
the city hall.

Despite being July and Christmas being away 5 months I already saw some
Christmas decoration in a tree. Maybe Christmas is not in December in
Australia, but in winter as well, as in the northern hemisphere?
