:summary: Billabong Sanctuary is a 10 hectare wildlife sanctuary south of
   Townsville.


Today, on my way to `Airlie Beach`_, I made a stop at the largely advertised
`Billabong Sanctuary`_, about 17 kilometers south of Townsville. It's nice to
see kangaroos, koalas and wombats up close, but at the same time one can see
that the "zoo" is not there natural environment: the animals walked around as
if they have neurotic personality disorders. Thus I'm not too happy with its
existence. Anyway, here are a few photos:
