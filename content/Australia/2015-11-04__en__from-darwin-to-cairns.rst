:summary: The only big thing between Darwin and Cairns is Mt Isa with its
   enormous mining industry.


Mount Isa
=========

After about 1,600 km from Darwin in the direction of Cairns the city of Mount
Isa pops up. With a population just above 20,000 it's rather small, but its
combined lead, silver, copper and zinc mine is one of the worlds most
productive ones, making Mt. Isa one of Australia's most important outback
cities.

There is a 2.5 h guided tour through a mine (not the real one but one build
specifically for the tours with original machinery -- costs about 12 million
AUD) that is worth it's price.

A few kilometers behind Mt Isa, before Cloncurry, there's gorgeous camping
spot at Lake Corella.

Cairns
======

An additional 1,100 km further down the highway (and some gravel roads), in
Cairns, I went for a 3 days / 2 nights (actually 4 days / 3 nights) liveaboard
diving trip for the first time of my life. What an exciting experience.
