My first stop today was the `Sydney Tower`_. The "Sydney Tower is Sydney's
tallest structure, it is also the second tallest observation tower in the
Southern Hemisphere, after Auckland's Sky Tower." [Wiki]_ To visit the
observation deck one needs a ticket. Presenting an international student
identity card (ISIC) I got a discount on the ticket.

From the Sydney Tower I walked through "The Rocks" over to the Darling Harbour
district having another great view on the Opera House from the Harbour Bridge
and the Skyline.
