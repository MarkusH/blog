:summary: Fraser Island (native name K'gari) is the biggest sand island on the
   world with a North to South size of about 125 km.


`Fraser Island`_ or *K'gari* as the aboriginal people call it is located off
the coast North of `Rainbow Beach`_ and the biggest sand island on the earth.
It spans almost 125 km from North to South. There are plenty of rivers and
creeks flowing from the island's center to into the ocean. All those rivers
carry fresh water. Although the ground on the island is out of sand Fraser
Island is mostly covered in forest.

Due to the sandy ground one is required to have a 4WD when wanting to drive
on the island. Fraser is a popular holiday and weekend location for Australians
as well as a touristic attraction with plenty of guided, self-driving tours.
