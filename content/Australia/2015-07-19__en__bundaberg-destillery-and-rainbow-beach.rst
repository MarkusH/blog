:summary: Since 1888 the Bundaberg Distilling Company produces rum made from sugar
   cane molasses.


The probably most worth knowing companies from `Bundaberg`_ are its sugar cane
mill and distillery. Bundaberg region is supposed to be the largest sugar
production area in Australia. The `Bundaberg Distilling Company`_, which I
visited today, was established in 1888. Ever since it produces its "Bundy".

The guided tour through the factory is worth doing. A guide explains the
different steps from the raw material, molasses, a byproduct of the sugar
production, until the final product. At the end one is allowed to taste 2 of
their rums and also buy them in their shop.

From Bundaberg I traveled down to `Rainbow Beach`_. The beach and surrounding
area seems to be nice, but the weather changed and rain came up.
