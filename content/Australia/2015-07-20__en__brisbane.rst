:summary: Brisbane is the capitol and largest city of Queensland and the third
   largest city in Australia.


From Rainbow Beach I traveled south to `Brisbane`_ where I will stay for 2
weeks, until the end of `PyCon Australia`_. During PyCon I'll present and
publish my master's thesis. So, stay tuned!

After arrival I took a bus into the CBD and walked around for a bit. I then
took one of the ferries to go to another side of the city. Brisbane looks a bit
like Manhattan, just a bit smaller and much cleaner!
