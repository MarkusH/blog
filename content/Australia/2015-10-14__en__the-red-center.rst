:summary: My next stop is Australia's Red Center with Alice Springs, the
   MacDonnell Ranges, Kings Canyon, Kata Tjuta and of course Ayers Rock
   (Uluru).


The drive down from Darwin to Alice Springs along the `Stuart Highway`_ wasn't
too exciting. I expected a much more different vegetation around Alice Springs,
but it looks quite similar to the one up in Darwin. Of course, there are
different plants there, but I didn't expect that many trees, bushes and grass.
The highway is named after John McDouall Stuart and his expedition in 1860.
There's one major attraction on the way South, though: Devils Marbles.

Alice Springs
=============

`Alice Springs`_ (most people just call it Alice) is a 35k city in the middle
of Australia. It's pretty much the only sensible city between Darwin in
Australia's North and Adelaide in the South. From ANZAC Hill you have a nice
look over the city and you can see some of the mountains of the MacDonnell
Ranges.

West MacDonnell Ranges
======================

From Alice I drove over to the West `MacDonnell Ranges`_. The mountain
formation provides some waterholes that are suitable for a short, refreshing
swim even at the end of the dry season. You want to make sure, though, to not
stay in the water too long as the water is very cold which may result in
hypothermia. There are also a couple of nice camping spots out there.

Kings Canyon
============

The `Kings Canyon`_ is only 320 km southwest of Alice but getting there is a bit
of a challenge when you passed the West MacDonnell Ranges before. You either
have to go back to Alice and make your way from there or you use a heavily
corrugated, private, gravel road (155 km) which requires a permit. Due to severe
temperature and the difficulty of the track (there's a steep ascent at the
beginning and no shade on the top), the Kings Canyon Rim Walk requires starting
the 6.5 km walk before 9 am. Rangers *will* lock the gate if the weather forecast
predicts more than 36 °C.

Ayers Rock (Uluru)
==================

`Uluru`_ / Ayers Rock is probably Australia's most important landmark nowadays.
The 348 m high rock was discovered by surveyor William Gosse in 1873 and named
after Chief Secretary of South Australia, Sir Henry Ayers. Today Uluru is part
of the `Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park`_. Although it's not prohibited to
climb, the Anangu (the local indigenous people) don't climb Uluru for its
spiritual significance and ask all visitors to respect their culture and not
climb Uluru either.

Kata Tjuta
==========

`Kata Tjuta`_ is a rock formation about 25 km west of Uluru and consists of 36
domes covering an area of almost 22 km². While Kata Tjuta is not as well known
as Uluru, it is 198 m taller. Their colloquial name *The Olgas* is derived from
it's highest mountain Mt Olga.
