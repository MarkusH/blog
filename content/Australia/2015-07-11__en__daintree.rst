:summary: Daintree is a small settlement about 130km north of Cairns and known
   for its rainforest and crocodile habitat.


The last 2 days I spent driving north to `Daintree`_, doing a crocodile cruise
and driving south to `Mission Beach`_.

Daintree is known for its crocodile habitat, the rainforest and the huge
`Daintree National Park`_ with about 1,200 kmÂ². During the cruise I luckily saw
a few crocs. The croc on the first photo is about 4.5 m long and roughly 80
years old. It's the largest one in that area.
