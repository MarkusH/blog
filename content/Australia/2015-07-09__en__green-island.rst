The `Green Island`_ is about 45 minutes boat ride east of Cairns and right at
the border to the Great Barrier Reef. I didn't took any underwater photos of
the corals as I don't own a proper camera or case. So there is just the one
from today's "Good morning #Australia and good evening #Germany" `tweet`_ and
one of the many palms on the island.
