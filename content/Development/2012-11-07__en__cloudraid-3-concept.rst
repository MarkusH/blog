This post is a continuation of the blog series about the student research paper
`CloudRAID`_.

I'm happy to announce the next part of our student research paper. Today Florian
`presents`_ the beginning of the third chapter that is all about the concept
behind ``CloudRAID``. His post covers the "Requirements" that need to be
fulfilled, the "General Architecture" of the server application and also gives
some insight on the "Server Architecture".
