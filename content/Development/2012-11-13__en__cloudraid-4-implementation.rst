This post is a continuation of the blog series about the student research paper
`CloudRAID`_.

After Florian's `publications about the architecture`_ the concrete
implementation design will follow.


4. Implementation
=================

4.1. JNI API
------------

The supplied RAID 5 implementation uses SHA-256 for integrity and validity
checks. The hash implementation has been taken from the `Apache Portable
Runtime Project (APR)`_ that has been published by the `Apache Software
Foundation`_ under the terms of the `Apache License version 2.0`_.


4.1.1. Pre-compiler Flags and Constants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The native RAID 5 level implementation uses multiple pre-compiler flags and
constants to control the split and merge processes:

#. ``RAID5BLOCKSIZE`` specifies how many bytes the library will write at once
   to each device file (default 1024 bytes). Hence ``RAID5BLOCKSIZE Ã— 2`` bytes
   are read at once from the input file.
#. Normally all data will be encrypted before it is being split into the device
   files. This can be changed by setting ``ENCRYPT_DATA`` to 0.
#. The constant ``ENCRYPTION_SALT_BYTES`` specifies the size of the salt in
   bytes. The default value is 256.
#. For debugging purposes, the ``DEBUG`` constant can be set. There are three
   debug levels possible, where 1 prints minimum debug information and 3 all. A
   value of 0 disables entirely disables the debug output.
#. ``_NAME_``, ``_VENDOR_`` and ``_VERSION_`` contain meta data for this
   library as exemplarily shown in listing 1. They information will be used by
   the native functions ``getName()``, ``getVendor()`` and ``getVersion()`` as
   explained in chapter `4.1.3 - Function Signatures`_.

.. code-block:: c

    #define RAID5BLOCKSIZE 1024
    #define ENCRYPT_DATA 1
    #define ENCRYPTION_SALT_BYTES 256
    #define DEBUG 0
    #define _NAME_ "CloudRAID-RAID5"
    #define _VENDOR_ "CloudRAID Team"
    #define _VERSION_ "1.0.0-beta.1"

*Listing 1: Pre-compiler flags and constants*


4.1.2. Structs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For internal storage purposes, the native RAID implementation needs two C
structs that are shown in listing 2:

#. Lines 1 to 6 show the SHA-256 context that allows to iteratively calculate
   the hash sum of data larger than an internal boundary size by storing the
   algorithms state, among other things, within this struct. This struct's
   usage, as well as how the Secure Hash Algorithm works, is not explained as
   part of this research paper.
#. Lines 7 to 15 represent the information stored in a meta data file:

   * First of all, each meta data file will contain a version number. This
     allows ``CloudRAID`` to implement backwards compatibility and makes the
     handling of new features to the native RAID implementation much more
     flexible.
   * The ``unsigned char`` arrays ``hash_dev0``, ``hash_dev1`` and
     ``hash_dev2`` are used to store the SHA-256 sum of  the regarding device
     files, while ``hash_in`` stores the hash sum of the original input file.
     This makes it possible to verify the integrity of the output file. If any
     device file has been compromised, include the corresponding hash sum, the
     integrity check of the output file will fail.
   * The salt is used to randomize the encryption key and hence increases the
     encryption strength.
   * Finally the missing element contains information about how many bytes are
     missing on the secondary device (not the parity device) to fill the
     complete block. This is necessary due to the way ``CloudRAID`` handles
     files of a size different to the internal RAID5 block size.

.. code-block:: c

    struct sha256_ctx {
      uint32_t state[8];
      uint32_t total[2];
      size_t buflen;
      uint32_t buffer[32];
    };

    typedef struct raid5md {
      unsigned char version;
      unsigned char hash_dev0[65];
      unsigned char hash_dev1[65];
      unsigned char hash_dev2[65];
      unsigned char hash_in[65];
      unsigned char salt[ENCRYPTION_SALT_BYTES];
      unsigned int missing;
    } raid5md;

imlementation*


4.1.3 Function Signatures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**The The Java Native Interface (JNI)** implements six functions whereof two
are directly used for the RAID features and three are used to determine some
version and vendor information about the library. The remaining, sixth,
function is used to exchange information about the size of the ``struct
raid5md`` from the library to ``CloudRAID``. The function signatures are shown
in listing 3 and will be explained here. All JNI functions take at least two
parameters: ``JNIEnv *env`` and ``jclass cls``. The former parameter refers to
the Java environment that provides functions to for example convert and access
strings. The latter is the instance of the current object the JNI function is
working in but is not used within the ``CloudRAID`` implementation.

#. ``mergeInterface()`` in lines 1 to 4 is the function that is called to merge
   three device files to the output file. It takes the directory where the
   device files are stored as first (additional) argument. The file's hash
   value is taken as second argument. The function will append the file
   extensions ``.0``, ``.1``, ``.2`` and ``.m`` automatically. The third
   parameter defines the full path to the output file. The target directory
   must exist, otherwise an error will be returned while trying to open the
   output file. The last parameter is the secret part of the key that has been
   used during encryption. One must keep in mind, that the
   ``_tempInputDirPath`` must contain a trailing folder separator. On Unix
   systems, this is most likely the forward slash (``/``) and on Microsoft
   Windows the backward slash (``\``).
#. ``splitInterface()``, as defined in lines 5 to 8, is the function signature
   for split calls. The function takes four additional parameters: the first
   one specifies the base input directory for the file that will be split.  The
   second parameter is the path, relative to the first parameter, that directs
   to the file. In a multi user environment, adding the user name or any other
   user-unique identifier to this relative path will ensure that every output
   file exists only once (as long as there are no hash collision for two files
   with different user identifiers). The file names for the output files will
   be the SHA-256 sum over the concatenation of ``_inputBasePath`` and
   ``_inputFilePath`` appended by ``.0``, ``.1`` and ``.2`` for the device
   files and ``.m`` for the meta data file.  The third parameter denotes the
   output directory. Finally, ``_key`` takes the secure part of the encryption
   key. In the same manner as in the ``mergeInterface()`` function, the paths
   ``_inputBasePath`` and ``_tempOutputDirPath`` must be terminated by folder
   separators.
#. The functions ``getName()``, ``getVendor()`` and ``getVersion()`` as defined
   in lines 9 to 14 do not take additional parameters. They can be used to show
   versioning information of this library that will then exemplarily be shown
   on the REST API information page (c.f. chapter `4.2.2 - Version Information`_).
#. Lines 15 and 16 show the ``getMetadataByteLength()`` function that is for
   ``CloudRAID`` core internal use only and must return the size of the meta
   data file in bytes.

.. code-block:: jni

    JNIEXPORT jint JNICALL Java_de_dhbw_1mannheim_cloudraid_core_impl_jni_RaidAccessInterface_mergeInterface(JNIEnv *env, jclass cls,
        jstring _tempInputDirPath, jstring _hash, jstring _outputFilePath,jstring _key);

*Listing 3: JNI header functions signatures.*

**The main internal functions** used by the primary two JNI functions above are
explained in this paragraph. For both processes, split and merge, there are two
functions each, ``split_file()`` and ``split_byte_block()`` (``merge_file()``
and ``merge_byte_block()`` respectively) that actually handle the processes
(see listing 4 at the end of this post). The JNI functions for split and merge
must be seen as wrapper for the ``split_file()`` and ``merge_file()``
functions. These functions handle the complete processes show by the figures 1
and 2 (introduced and explained in a `previous article`_ of this article
series). All ``FILE*`` parameters must be correctly opened for read or write
access. On Unix systems this includes the binary ``b`` mode for ``fopen()``.

#. ``split_file()`` expects a file pointer (``rb`` mode) to the input file as
   first parameter. The ``FILE *devices[]`` array must contain three elements
   to files opened in ``wb`` mode. These files are the device files. The
   ``meta`` parameter points to the meta data file as must have been opened in
   ``wb`` mode as well. ``const char *key`` is the secure key used for file
   encryption and will be passed to the ``hmac()`` function together with its
   length ``keylen``.

   .. figure:: /images/cloudraid/flowchart-native-split.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Split process operation flowchart

      *Figure 15: The nativ split process*

   This function reads up to ``2 Ã— RAID5BLOCKSIZE`` for each iteration shown in
   figure 1. These bytes are encrypted with the key generated by ``hmac()`` if
   ``ENCRYPT_DATA`` is not 0 and then passed to ``split_byte_block()``. The
   call-by-reference "return" values are written to the device files. After
   each iteration the parity position is incremented. Starting with device 2 as
   parity for the first block, the parity position will be 0 for the second
   block and 1 for the third block. The forth block will restart with position
   2.
#. The ``split_byte_block()`` function takes the bytes read and encrypted in
   ``split_file()`` as first parameter and the length of that buffer as second
   parameter. The function splits the input character array in three parts that
   will be returned via the ``unsigned char *out`` parameter. The output size
   for each device is returned via the fourth parameter: ``size_t out_len[]``.
   The alignment for the output buffer is as follows:

   * The primary device content will be stored at ``out[0]``. Its length is
     ``out_len[0]``.
   * The secondary device content will be stored at ``out[RAID5BLOCKSIZE]``.
     Its length is ``out_len[1]``.
   * The tertiary device content, representing the parity device, will be
     stored at ``out[2 * RAID5BLOCKSIZE]``. Its length is ``out_len[2]``.

   Depending on the input length ``in_len`` the values of ``out_len[0]`` to
   ``out_len[2]`` may vary:

   .. math::

      \overrightarrow{\text{out_len}} = \left\{
      \begin{array}{l l}
          \begin{pmatrix}
              \text{in_len}\\
              0\\
              \text{in_len}
          \end{pmatrix} & \quad \text{if in_len $\leq$ BS}\\
          \begin{pmatrix}
              \text{BS}\\
              \text{in_len} - \text{BS}\\
              \text{BS}
          \end{pmatrix} & \quad \text{if in_len $>$ BS}\\
      \end{array} \right.

#. ``merge_file()`` is the inverse function to ``split_file()``. It basically
   has the same function signature, but the first parameter specifies the
   output file unlike in ``split_file()`` and hence must be opened in ``wb``
   mode. Thus the device files and meta data file, parameters two and three,
   are input files and therefore they must be opened in ``rb`` mode. The fourth
   parameter, ``const char *key`` is the secure key used for file decryption
   and will be passed to the ``hmac()`` function together with its length
   ``keylen`` in the same way as in ``split_file()``.

   .. figure:: /images/cloudraid/flowchart-native-merge.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Merge process operation flowchart

      *Figure 16: The native merge process*

   At first, the integrity of the device files is validated as shown in figure
   2 by checking the hash sums for the device files. If more than two check
   sums are wrong the function terminates with an error. Otherwise the function
   will read up to ``RAID5BLOCKSIZE`` from each device file and passes those
   buffers with their respective lengths to ``merge_byte_block()``. The
   call-by-reference "return" value from each block merge is passed to a
   SHA-256 context to validate the correctness of the output file and then
   decrypted.
#. The actual merge occurs in the ``merge_byte_block()`` function. Again the
   content for all three buffers is stored in a single character array as first
   parameter: ``const unsigned char *in``. The second parameter, ``const size_t
   in_len[]`` represents the lengths for the three read buffers from the device
   files. Both parameters together align the input buffers in the same way as
   in ``split_byte_block()``:

   * The primary device content will be stored at ``in[0]``.Its length is
     ``in_len[0]``.
   * The secondary device content will be stored at ``in[RAID5BLOCKSIZE]``. Its
     length is ``in_len[1]``.
   * The tertiary device content, representing the parity device, will be
     stored at ``in[2 * RAID5BLOCKSIZE]``. Its length is ``in_len[2]``.

   The third parameter, ``parity_pos``, specifies which device is the parity.
   This is necessary in combination with the fourth parameter, ``dead_device``,
   to determine the merge strategy: concatenating the content of the buffers
   for device files 0 and 1 or using the parity in combination with either of
   first two device files. ``missing`` defines how many bytes are missing on
   the secondary device. Only the last block of each overall merge process may
   set this parameter to a value ``> 0``. The penultimate parameter, ``*out``
   stores the merged data with a total length of ``*out_len`` but at most ``2 Ã—
   RAID5BLOCKSIZE``.
#. ``create_salt()``: the complete security of the whole encryption process
   relies on the strength of the key given to ``split_file()`` and
   ``merge_file()``. However, to protect the data against attacks using rainbow
   tables the encryption key is being salted. The salt of length
   ``ENCRYPTION_SALT_BYTES`` is generated by this function. On Microsoft
   Windows each byte of the salt will be set by a return value of ``rand()``
   after initializing the pseudo random generator with ``srand(time(NULL))``.
   On all other *Operating Systems* (OSs), that can be expect to be Unix, the
   functions reads ``ENCRYPTION_SALT_BYTES`` from ``/dev/urandom`` which can be
   seen to be random.
#. The salted key used during encryption and decryption is created by the
   function ``hmac()``. This function is an implementation of the *Federal
   Information Processing Standards Publication* (FIPS PUB) 198 [NIS02] HMAC
   specification and takes five parameters: the first two parameters (``*key``
   and ``keylen``) define the secure key given by the JNI function
   ``split_file()`` and ``merge_file()``. Parameters three and four link to the
   ``*salt`` (optimally generated by the ``create_salt()`` function) and its
   length that is ``ENCRYPTION_SALT_BYTES`` by default. The last parameter,
   ``*hash``, is a call-by-reference parameter and "returns" the HMAC for the
   given ``*key`` and ``*salt``.

The general mode of operation can be expressed by the following two
expressions:

.. math::

    H \; &= \; \text{The underlying hash function, here SHA-256}\\
    B \; &= \; \text{The internal block size of $H$ in bytes, here 64}\\
    L \; &= \; \text{The block size of the output of $H$ in bytes, here 32}\\
    K \; &= \; \text{The input key}\\
    S \; &= \; \text{The salt}\\
    |x| \; &= \; \text{Defines the length of a string x}\\
    \oplus \; &= \; \text{Bitwise XOR}\\
    \| \; &= \; \text{Concatenation}

    x^y \; &= \; \underbrace{x\| x\|\cdots x\| x}_\text{$y$ times}\\
    pad_i \; &= \; 0x36^B\\
    pad_o \; &= \; 0x5C^B\\
    K_0 \; &= \; \left\{
        \begin{array}{l l}
            K \| 0x00^{B-|K|} & \quad \text{if $|K| < B$ }\\
            K & \quad \text{if $|K| = B$}\\
            H(K) \| 0x00^{B-L} & \quad \text{if $|K| > B$ }\\
        \end{array} \right.

    \text{HMAC} \; = \; H((K_0 \oplus pad_o) \| H((K_0 \oplus pad_i) \| S))

The implementation of the HMAC [NIS02]_ standard has been validated by
computing the digest values for the test cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 defined in
RFC 4231 [Nys05]_. Test case 5 has not been tested since the truncation is not
needed in ``CloudRAID`` and was therefore not implemented.
