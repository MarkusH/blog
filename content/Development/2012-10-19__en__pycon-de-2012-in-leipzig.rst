At the end of October 2012 another `PyCon <https://2012.de.pycon.org/>`_ takes
place. This time the venue is the `Kubus in Leipzig, Germany <http://www
.leipziger-kubus.ufz.de/>`_. As this is my first participation at a Python
conference I'm a bit excited about this event.

First of all, I like the `wide range of various topics
<https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/>`_ that are offered. There are
presentations about `Machine Learning
<https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/26/>`_ (Oct 30 @ 1:30pm
in Hall 2) and `Efficient Data Analysis
<https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/20/>`_ (Oct 30 @ 2pm in
Hall 1B). Other talks address the topic of computer graphics (`SimpleCV: Fun
with Computer Vision
<https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/56/>`_, Oct 31 @ 1:30pm
in Hall 2; `Tiffany - Reading and Writing Multipage Tiff Files w/ and w/o PIL
<https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/72/>`_, Nov 1 @ 11am in
Hall 1A). And of course, there are multiple presentations covering different
parts of the Django web framework: `LFS - A Django based webshop
<https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/55/>`_ (Oct 31 @ 2pm in
Hall 1C), `Overview over the Django admin area
<https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/43/>`_ (Oct 31 @ 11am in
Hall 1C) `Django Class Based Generic Views
<https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/52/>`_ (Oct 31 @ 1pm in
Hall 1C) and many, many more talks.

Second, while looking through all the talks I just picked some I think I'm
going to attend:


* Tuesday, October 30th
   * `Cython with PyPy <https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/17/>`_
   * `Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn <https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/26/>`_
   * `Efficient Data Analysis with Pandas <https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/20/>`_

* Wednesday, October 31st
   * `Fast loops with Cython <https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/41/>`_
   * `Designing and Testing PyZMQ Applications <https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/50/>`_

* Thursday, November 1st
   * `Python Web Sprints <https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/63/>`_
   * `The Toolbox of a Python (Web) Developer <https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/58/>`_ *or*
   * `Agile Database Development <https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/66/>`_


During the barcamp and the sprints on Nov 2nd and 3rd I will work on `Inyoka
<http://trac.inyokaproject.org>`_ and fix a bunch of tickets (the list of open
issues is way too long).

So, if you are at the PyCon DE 2012 too, leave a comment and we can meet.
